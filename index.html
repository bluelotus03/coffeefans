                <p>Welcome welcome all you bean lovers! </p>
                <p>We know the past year has been tough... While it was most likely great for the 
                  money in our pockets, it took away one of our greatest loves.. coffee shops. Yes, 
                  we know your pain. The pure devastation of coffee shop deprivation... No new 
                  brews, no sounds of the grinder, no love in the air.. </p>
                <p>Okay, okay, enough sulking. We gotcha covered here (:</p>
                <p>Here at Coffee Lovers, we are bringing all the feels to you virtually! 
                  So many good vibes and visuals, you can almost taste the espresso! 
                  We have ways for you to bring the sounds, backdrops, and people of the coffee shops to your very own kitchen.</p> 
                <p> How will we do this you ask?</p> 
                <p> Well, our Vibes page has got you covered on music, imagery, and all your coffee shop nostalgia. Our Recipes page has easy-to-follow instructions to make your own crafty drinks at home (many without any fancy machines). And last, but certainly not least, our Connect page has a listing of groups all          around the world that you can join and virtually sip your coffee together. 
                  <p>And just like the in-person shops, you don't have to talk to anyone! You just turn on your web cam and add our backdrop to your video. Others will do the same, and before you know it, you have recreated a shop together!<p>   
                <p>If you want to bring those coffee smells and new flavors to life, you can check out our new products. We will ship you a complementary basket containing some new coffee flavors, chocolate covered espresso, a new mug, and more just for becoming a new patron.</p>
